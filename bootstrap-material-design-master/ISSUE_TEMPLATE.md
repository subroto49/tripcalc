This isn't a support forum, if you find a bug, feel free to report it following the indications provided below. Create a Pull Request that fixes the bug if you want to see it fixed, I haven't so much time to fix all the bugs that get reported and I can't promise that they will get fixed anytime soon. I have my own priorities.

**All** bug reports must contain a test case using one of **our** Codepen templates;  Bug reports without one will be summarily closed:
- `v3` Codepen template - http://codepen.io/rosskevin/pen/VvRgrN 
- `v4` Codepen template - http://codepen.io/rosskevin/pen/eJMMVB

If your problem is related to the build steps, please create a repository on GitHub with all the files necessary to reproduce the problem and nothing else.
